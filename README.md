# Household Power Consumption
Electricity consumption analysis of a household over a period of almost four years

## Overview

IOT Analytics is working on a new project with a regional home developer to develop analytics for 
a new set of electrical submetering devices used for power management in Smart Homes. 
Installing these submeters could be a big step towards the developer's goal of offering highly efficient
Smart Homes that providing owners with power analytics.

As a starting point, the regional home developer has provided us with a large dataset that contains
47 months of energy usage data from these devices. Our objective is to develop analytics and visualizations 
that can empower Smart Home owners with greater understanding and control of their power usage.


### Dataset information
In the dataset we have measurements of electric power consumption in one household with a 
one-minute sampling rate over a period of almost 4 years. Different electrical quantities and
submetering values are available. The dataset contains 2 075 259 measurements gathered in a house located in
Sceaux (7km south of Paris, France) between December 2006 and November 2010 (47 months).

##### Attribute information
>1. Date: date in format dd/mm/yyyy 
>2. Time: time in format hh:mm:ss
>3. Global_active_power: household global minute-averaged active power (in kilowatt)
>4. Global_reactive_power: household global minute-averaged reactive power (in kilowatt)
>5. Voltage: minute-averaged voltage (in volt)
>6. Global_intensity: household global minute-averaged current intensity (in ampere)
>7. Sub_metering_1: energy sub-metering No. 1 (in watt-hour of active energy). 
It corresponds to the kitchen, containing mainly a dishwasher, an oven and a microwave 
(hot plates are not electric but gas powered).
>8. Sub_metering_2: energy sub-metering No. 2 (in watt-hour of active energy). 
It corresponds to the laundry room, containing a washing-machine, a tumble-drier, a refrigerator and a light.
>9. Sub_metering_3: energy sub-metering No. 3 (in watt-hour of active energy). 
It corresponds to an electric water-heater and an air-conditioner.
